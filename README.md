## python-snake
A small game I made in the frame of around 4 hours. I wanted to practice my logical thinking, so I implemented my logic. My solution is not likely an optimal one, but I see nothing wrong with the code.

Features
- Collecting food to grow
- Window borders
- Self-collision detection
- Sounds

Initially, I haven't used OOP, but I switched to it as it seemed more elegant and practical. Feel free to use, edit or distribute this code. Attribution is not required.
